A CLI Python tool that takes a magnet link and outputs a torrent file.

Requires:
  python 2.6+
  python wrapped libtorrent 

Known issues:
  Multi-file torrents don't seem to be working right now


It would seem I'm not the only person looking in to this issue:
According to [ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8689828/libtorrent-given-a-magnet-link-how-do-you-generate-a-torrent-file ]  the python API is broken right now, but will be fixed in the next version [ http://code.google.com/p/libtorrent/issues/detail?id=294 ]
